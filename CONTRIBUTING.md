# Contributing

We are always looking for new contributors. As the project grows ,we will have some more structure around the process, but for now, feel free to clone and make changes. We review all PRs and will provide feedback either way. 

We are happy with all contributions, ranging from comments, docs, tests, or new functionality. Just try your best to ensure there are unit tests for code contributions if possible.
